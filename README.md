# Module 9 - Surfs Up!!

## Purpose:

This project is to analyze weather data in Hawaii in order to set up a surfboard shop. Using Python and SQLite, temperature and precipation data was gathered in order to explore
the viability of a surfboard shop. The data set examines results from the year 2010 to 2017. The temperature data is shown in Fahrenheit. 

## Results:
### Deliverable 1:

These are the results for the June temperatures.

### Deliverable 2:

These are the results for the December temperatures.

From these results we can see the following.

- On average, the temperature is about 3 degrees colder in December than in June.
- The coldest day in December is 8 degrees colder than June's coldest day
- June's hottest day is 2 degrees hotter than December's hottest day

## Summary:

The results ended up being fairly similar for these two datasets. There is a little more volatility in the December dataset with its higher standard deviation so there will be
more days in December that wouldn't be appropriate for surfing so the shop would have to adjust and have a plan for that. The data shows there would be an opportunity however 
to keep the shop open year-round. I would suggest running 2 additional queries to account for all of the seasons, one in March and one in September to provide additional insights
into the patterns all year.
